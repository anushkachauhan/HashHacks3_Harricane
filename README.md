Abstract <br>
Political Campaigns are difficult to conduct and requires much time, patience and money. To ease the process of campaigning and make voters realize the importance of voting to the users, we have come up with an idea of application. In India, many walks of society do not know the importance of voting. Our prototype will use gesture recognition to make users help understand the EVM machine. They would get to know about the different symbols of different political parties. Also to make campaigning easier and increase the reach of the political leaders, we tend to increase their popularity using handshakes facility and selfie facility with the leader using 3D models.
